<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Inventory Management System is a web application built using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Bootstrap, and EJS to help users manage their inventory effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and tracking items in stock.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Item Management: Users can add new items to the inventory, each with a name, description, price, and quantity.

Real-time Updates: The application offers three purchase buttons for each item - Buy1, Buy2, and Buy3. Clicking these buttons reduces the respective item's quantity by 1, 2, or 3, providing real-time updates on stock levels.

Item Editing: Users have the ability to edit any field of an existing item, making it easy to keep item details up to date.</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<p>
Node.js: The application's backend is powered by Node.js, allowing for efficient server-side processing.

Express.js: Express.js is used to build the web server and handle HTTP requests and routing.

MySQL: MySQL is the chosen database system for storing and managing inventory data.

Sequelize: Sequelize is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the MySQL database, making database operations simpler and more organized.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap provides a responsive and visually appealing front-end design, enhancing the user experience.

EJS: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates are used for rendering dynamic HTML content, allowing for seamless integration of data from the server.</p>
